Bought this after much thoughts by trusting the name Lenevo .I have been using redmi note 4 & it never had any issues with battery or even camera . Listening to music through YouTube , Browsing, Facebook , Insta , still solid backup for more than a dayI have 4 other phones also , MOTO G3 & Samsung S3 , HTC 628G , Samsung J7 Prime .This phone(Lenevo K8) seems to be worst among all.1)Battery : Has left me shattered with its worst battery life , Have just used to take some pictures , YouTube & songs , it goes down very Fast . (Yet to enter two sim card & use WhatsApp , Gmail , so if it continues to become more worst I'd surely update & escalate this )2),Camera Quality(For a dual camera , it is nowhere near Honor 6x which is 1k lesser) .if you are tricked by the dual camera ( it still has not got update of slowmo , Time lapse ) but it is really good when taken in Professional Mode with manual iso & focussing.A disaster in auto mode , that too for a rear camera with dual lens .I wish the company wakes up and starts rolling out OTA update for Camera & Battery life improvement.Other than that , The phone is super smooth , Display , Touch , Finger print sensor & stock Android is a bit of self satisfaction that I can say to myself for wasting 14K .I thought of gifting it to my father , but this would make it surely an incomplete gift .!Wish the company looks into these issues & provides updates for the Camera & Battery life because that is what it was paid for & marketed by the company claiming those 2 are the highlight factors.Lost interest to Even post pictures of it.With much regret.\"),\n",

In depth enabled mode the camera struggles to focus. You will find the edges of the object are blurred along with the background. Without depth enabled mode both front and back cameras are just average.Processor & Battery - The Mediatek helio x23 processor is good in performance but since it is clocked at 2.3 ghz, the gets heated even on normal uses or while while charging. It aslo consumes the battery very fast, The 4000 mAH battery will hardly last for 1 day on normal uses.Sound Clarity - Nice Sound Clarity on speaker as well as earphone. Thanks to Dolby atmos.Display - Screen clarity is good.UI - Its a user choice, I am not a stock android fan as it lacks many features comes with custom roms like MIUI. Otherwise there is no problems with UI, it runs pretty smooth.Final verdict - Its just a average phone, there are many other good options available in market at same price point.

Dolby atmos sound output is of average quality, it was better on earlier lenovo's. The headset volume while on call is very low compared to previous lenovo's, redmi & mi, samsung's. Making K8 note pure android experience, lenovo has robbed users of some good features available on the previous lenovo's. Hence the software is a big let down, lenovo should have stripped down the vibe UI to near stock experience instead of dumping it. Also, a phone cant be called a killer if it doesnt have the basic function of backlit keys at the bottom. Software experience is not smooth as it should be considering the ram and motherboard and coupled with stock android.In my opinion, K8 note is nothing of what it was projected to be and the previous lenovo's were slightly better minus the full hd displays on them.\"),\n",
